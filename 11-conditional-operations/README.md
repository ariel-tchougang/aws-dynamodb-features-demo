# Lab 11: Conditional Operations in DynamoDB

In this lab, you'll learn how to use conditional expressions with DynamoDB operations to implement optimistic locking and ensure data consistency.

## What are Conditional Operations?

Conditional operations allow you to perform write operations (put, update, delete) only if certain conditions are met. This helps you:

1. Implement optimistic concurrency control
2. Prevent overwriting of data
3. Create idempotent operations
4. Ensure data consistency

## Lab Overview

In this lab, you'll:

1. Implement optimistic locking using version numbers
2. Perform conditional put operations
3. Perform conditional update operations
4. Perform conditional delete operations
5. Handle condition failures

## Instructions

### Step 1: Run Conditional Put Example

Run the provided script to see conditional put operations in action:

```bash
python conditional_put.py
```

This will demonstrate:
- Creating an item only if it doesn't already exist
- Preventing accidental overwrites

### Step 2: Run Conditional Update Example

Run the provided script to see conditional update operations in action:

```bash
python conditional_update.py
```

This will demonstrate:
- Implementing optimistic locking with version numbers
- Handling concurrent updates

### Step 3: Run Conditional Delete Example

Run the provided script to see conditional delete operations in action:

```bash
python conditional_delete.py
```

This will demonstrate:
- Deleting items only if they meet certain conditions
- Preventing accidental deletions

## Next Steps

Once you've completed this lab, proceed to [Lab 12: Batch Operations](../12-batch-operations/) to learn how to perform batch operations in DynamoDB.
