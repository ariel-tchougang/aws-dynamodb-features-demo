# üéÆ GameLeaderboard: DynamoDB Features Demo

Welcome to the GameLeaderboard DynamoDB demo! In this hands-on lab, you'll learn how to use Amazon DynamoDB by building a game leaderboard system for "Cosmic Defenders," a fictional multiplayer space battle game.

## üöÄ Scenario

You're a backend developer for "Cosmic Defenders," a popular online game where players battle in space arenas. The game needs a robust leaderboard system that can:

- Track player scores, achievements, and battle history
- Handle millions of concurrent players during peak hours
- Provide fast access to leaderboard data for different game modes
- Support time-limited seasonal competitions with automatic data expiration
- Process transactions for in-game rewards and achievements
- Scale automatically during major game events

This scenario is perfect for demonstrating DynamoDB's capabilities as it requires high performance, scalability, and various access patterns.

## üìã Lab Features

This hands-on lab will guide you through implementing the following DynamoDB features:

1. **Table Creation** - Create a table with composite primary key, Local Secondary Index (LSI), and Global Secondary Index (GSI)
2. **Data Loading** - Generate and load game data into the table
3. **Basic CRUD Operations** - Perform put-item, update-item, get-item, delete-item operations
4. **Query Performance Testing** - Compare query performance using partition key vs. GSI
5. **Scan Operations** - Explore various scan techniques and pagination
6. **Exponential Backoff** - Handle throttling with retry mechanisms
7. **Parallel Scan** - Improve scan performance with parallel processing
8. **Auto-scaling** - Observe DynamoDB adapting to changing workloads
9. **Time to Live (TTL)** - Automatically expire seasonal game data
10. **Transactions** - Ensure data consistency for critical game operations
11. **Conditional Operations** - Implement optimistic locking for game state updates
12. **Batch Operations** - Process multiple items efficiently
13. **CloudWatch Metrics** - Monitor and analyze DynamoDB performance

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- AWS Account with appropriate permissions
